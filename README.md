# Anomaly Detection

Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in sales data. It involves two primary components: a Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing, and another Notebook for modeling, accompanied by an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

Objectives
Explore and preprocess the sales data.
Apply various anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in the data.
Visualize the findings using an interactive dashboard.

Steps
1) EDA + Preprocessing
2) Statistical Techniques + Machine Learning Models
3) Interactive Dashboard
